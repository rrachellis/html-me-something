       <p>A New Brain was the first theatrical production I stage managed or assistant directed for. I was entirely out of my element but excited to take on the task. The show went well and even ended up winning an award for Best Small Ensemble Musical Production at the 2020 AFL Awards (the St. Louis non-professional theatre awards.)</p>

           <p>During God of Carnage I was one of three stage managers which was definitely an interesting experience. I've been doing theatre since middle school and this is the only show I've worked on where everyone liked each other and nothing went wrong and I'll always treasure that.</p>

               <p>This was the first performance where I had an assistant stage manager! I really miss her. We all got into a lot of shenanigans with this show and I'm sad we had to reschedule so close to opening due to COVID. Hopefully once this is all over the show will go on!</p>

               <p>This will be the St. Louis regional premier of Fun Home, which is incredibly exciting! We cast this show in quarantine using taped auditions with lofty expectations. Unfortunately this show would get postponed as well. I'm looking forward to being able to finally start rehearsals!</p>
